Modeling of H2CO line ratios based on RADEX (or other) model grids

Examples are in the examples directory:

 * `plot_line_brightnesses <plot_line_brightnesses.py>`_: 
   make some plots of H2CO line brightnesses and ratios as a function of
   density for different background temperatures, sometimes including a modeled
   underyling density distribution

 * `plot_line_brightnesses_22_33 <plot_line_brightnesses_22_33.py>`_:
   the same but for the 2-2 and 3-3 cm lines

 * `ratio_to_dens_plots <ratio_to_dens_plots.py>`_
   Simple 1-1/2-2 vs density plots (not as sophisticated as the others)
